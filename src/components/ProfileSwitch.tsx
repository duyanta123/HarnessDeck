 * the title bar is the only place left that can still say which stack is running.
 *
 * A menu and not a segmented control. There is no fixed number of profiles, the
 * names are the user's own and can be long, and every one of them carries more
 * than a name: whether it can serve a window at all is worth knowing before
 * switching to it rather than after.
