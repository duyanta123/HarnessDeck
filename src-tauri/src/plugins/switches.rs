//! Plugins that are installed but switched off.
//!
//! The harness has no idea of an installed plugin that is not running. After
//! every plugin command it reconciles `dsh.profile.bundles` against what is on
//! disk, so a name taken out of that list is put straight back the next time
//! anything is installed or removed. Switching a plugin off without
//! uninstalling it therefore has to be a fact the shell keeps and re-asserts,
//! which is all this module is.
//!
//! The manifest still belongs to the harness. Nothing here invents a layer: it
//! takes out a name the user switched off and puts back the one they switched
//! on again. If a name put back turns out not to declare a patch after all, the
//! harness's own reconciliation drops it — the rule stays in one place, and the
//! shell does not need a copy of it to be correct.
//!
//! Every way into the record comes in a pair: the function the app calls, which
//! knows where the record lives, and the one under it, which is told. That is
//! what lets the chain this module exists for — switch off, install again,
//! restart, still off — be driven end to end over a scratch directory. Without
//! it the only way to exercise any of this is to write to the record belonging
//! to whoever is running the tests, which is why that chain went so long with
//! no coverage of its own.
