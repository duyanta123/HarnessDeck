//! The harnesses one installation can hold, and which of them this window hosts.
//!
//! A profile is a directory under `$DSH_HOME/profiles` with a manifest in it:
//! the layer list the harness composes at boot, and the plugins it was composed
//! from. The harness ships a template for the names it knows — `web` is the one
//! with an interface in it — writes the directory on first use, and otherwise
//! takes the directory name as the profile's whole identity. So the shell needs
//! no model of what a profile *is*. It needs to be able to make one, copy one,
//! name one, take one away, and say how two of them differ.
//!
//! Making one is the part with a subtlety worth writing down. The harness's own
//! initializer gives a name it has no template for the default bundle list,
//! which is the base layer and nothing else: a profile that boots and serves no
//! interface, so a window pointed at it would sit waiting for a page that is
//! never coming. A new profile is therefore written here, from the bundles the
//! shipped web profile is carrying on this machine — not from a copy of the
//! harness's template kept in this repository, which would be a second copy of
//! someone else's constant and would go stale the first time they changed it.
//!
//! Everything that installs goes back out through `dsh plugin`, the same command
//! the market uses. Nothing here resolves a package or writes a `dependencies`
//! entry: a manifest claiming something is installed that is not would boot into
//! the harness's own "cannot resolve bundle" error, and the shell has no business
//! producing that.
