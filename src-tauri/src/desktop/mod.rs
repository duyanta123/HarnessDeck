//! The desktop, offered to whatever the harness is running.
//!
//! A plugin the user installs runs as a page inside the harness, and a page
//! cannot do the four things that make a desktop application worth having: say
//! something while nobody is looking at the window, ask for a file by its real
//! path, put a count where the window is not, or be opened by a link from
//! somewhere else. This is the interface that lends those four out.
//!
//! Deliberately four and not forty. The shell can run shell commands; the point
//! of a narrow interface is that everything it grants can be read in one sitting,
//! and everything it does not grant is not a decision anybody has to re-derive.
//! Growing it is a version bump, which is why the version is in the handshake.
//!
//! The trust boundary is the origin. Requests are taken from the harness's own
//! origin and from nowhere else — not from a page it frames from the internet,
//! and not at all while nothing is serving. That check lives in the shell's
//! frontend, next to the frame it applies to; see `src/lib/bridge.ts`.
