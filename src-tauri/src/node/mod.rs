//! Put a Node runtime on a machine that has none.
//!
//! The harness is a Node program, so before this shell can do anything at all
//! the machine needs a Node. Asking for one is the honest answer for a developer
//! tool and the wrong one for an application someone downloaded: "install this
//! other thing first, from a different website, then come back" is where most
//! people stop. So the shell installs one itself, into its own data directory,
//! where it belongs to the shell and not to the user's `PATH`.
//!
//! Three things make that defensible rather than presumptuous:
//!
//! - It is opt-in. Nothing here runs until someone presses the button on the row
//!   that says Node is missing.
//! - It is contained. The runtime goes under application data, one directory per
//!   release, and nothing outside this application is changed — no `PATH`, no
//!   registry, no `/usr/local`. Deleting the directory undoes it.
//! - It is verified. The archive is checked against the SHA-256 the release
//!   channel publishes before a single file is unpacked, and the unpacked runtime
//!   has to answer `--version` before it is reported as installed.
//!
//! A Node the user installed themselves always still wins a tie — see
//! `Source::rank` in the detection crate.
